The script is designed for calculation of the reaction rate according to the 
Eyring transition state theory (see H. Eyring, J. Chem. Phys. 3, 107 (1935) 
for details).

Input files:
OUTCAR_in - initial state file from harmonic frequencies calculation with VASP
OUTCAR_ts - transition state file ...
OUTCAR_fi - final state file ...

Run main.py and follow instructions.
